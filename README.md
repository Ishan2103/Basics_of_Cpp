## ðŸ“Œ Programs Included

### ðŸ”¹ Program 1: Hello World and Introduction

#### ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
This program prints a greeting message on the console. It's the traditional first program that helps you verify your compiler setup and understand basic output operations.

#### ðŸ§  Concepts Covered
- **Standard Library Usage**: Includes `#include <iostream>` for input/output functionality.
- **Program Entry Point**: Defines the `main()` function, which acts as the starting point of execution.
- **Console Output**: Uses `std::cout` to display messages on the terminal.
- **Output Formatting**: Demonstrates line breaks using `\n` or `endl`.
- **Program Termination**: Ends with `return 0;` indicating successful execution.

### ðŸ”¹ Program 2: Arithmetic Operations

#### ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
This program takes two numbers as input and performs **basic arithmetic operations**: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

#### ðŸ§  Concepts Covered
- **User Input**: Uses `std::cin` to read user-provided values.
- **Data Types**: Demonstrates use of `float` or `double` for decimal numbers.
- **Arithmetic Operators**: Uses `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` to perform operations.
- **Variables**: Stores and displays results using separate variables.
- **Operator Precedence**: Reinforces order of operations in expressions.
- **Division by Zero (Validation)**: Introduces the need for validating input before division.

## âœ… Conclusion

These introductory C++ programs cover essential programming constructs such as input/output handling, variables, arithmetic operations, and console formatting.  
They form a foundational base for understanding how C++ programs are written, compiled, and executed, and pave the way for exploring control structures, functions, and object-oriented programming.

By completing these exercises, you gain familiarity with:
- Writing and running basic C++ programs
- Using input/output streams
- Performing arithmetic calculations with user input

This marks the beginning of your journey into the powerful world of C++ programming.
